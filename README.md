# fan2servo
Arduino - Convert the 3D printer fan signal to a PWM standard servo signal

Project developed in Atmel Studio 7 for Arduino Uno and LCD Keypad Shield.
Fan PWM input connected to pin 2.
Servo output connected to pin 3.

Protection components needed on pin 2 to deal with harmful voltages from the fan
PWM drive circuit.
